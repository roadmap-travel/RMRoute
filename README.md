## Summary

RMRoute makes it easy to provide access to all your features from anywhere in your app. With bigger applications it's sometimes handy to have entry points to your features, without referencing to them by class.

## Features

- [x] Registering & calling routes
- [x] Pass parameters in route
- [x] Routes case insensitive
- [x] Swift 3 compatible
- [ ] Named parameters

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 3.0

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.0.0+ is required to build RMRoute.

To integrate RMRoute into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'RMRoute'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.

## Usage

### Registering a route

#### Simple registration

Example without parameters

```swift
import RMRoute

RMRoute.register("about") { (delegate, animation, params) in
			
	// Just show the vc
	let vc = AboutViewController()
	delegate.animate(vc, animation: animation) // This is an UIViewController extension which handles the animation type

	return true
}
```

```objc
[RMRoute registerWithPath:@"about" action:^BOOL (UIViewController *delegate, RMRouteAnimation animation, NSArray *params) {
		
	// Just show the vc
	AboutViewController *vc = [[AboutViewController alloc] init];
	[delegate animate:vc animation:animation]; // This is an UIViewController extension which handles the animation type

	return YES;
}];
```

#### More advanced registration

Example with parameters

```swift
import RMRoute

RMRoute.register("faq/{itemId}") { (delegate, animation, params) in

	let itemId = params[0]
	guard itemId.isEmpty == false else {
		return false
	}

	// Just show the vc
	let vc = FAQViewController(itemId)
	delegate.animate(vc, animation: animation)

	return true
}
```

```objc
[RMRoute registerWithPath:@"faq/{itemId}" action:^BOOL (UIViewController *delegate, RMRouteAnimation animation, NSArray *params) {

	NSString *itemId = params[0];

	if (itemId.length == 0) return NO;
		
	// Just show the vc
	FAQViewController *vc = [[FAQViewController alloc] initWithItemId:itemId];
	[delegate animate:vc animation:animation];

	return YES;
}];
```

### Calling a route

#### Simple call

Example without parameters

```swift
import RMRoute

RMRoute.navigate("about", delegate: self, animation: .push)
```

```objc
[RMRoute navigate:@"about" delegate:self animation:RMRouteAnimationPush];
```

#### More advanced call

Example with parameters

```swift
import RMRoute

RMRoute.navigate("faq/12", delegate: self, animation: .present)
```

```objc
[RMRoute navigate:@"faq/12" delegate:self animation:RMRouteAnimationPresent];
```
